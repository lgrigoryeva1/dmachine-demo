### A simple Flask server that controls a drink machine
This is a simplified version of the Mimosa Machine. 


The Flask server contains a button that controls the drink machine.

To recreate, you will need:
* 2 solenoid valves
* 12V air pump
* A relay
* Power supply for the solenoids
* A Raspberry Pi (model 3 is used in the demo)

To run the code:
`python3 drink.py`

Use `sudo` if you are using a protected port (e.g. 80)
